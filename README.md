This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

1.) Created the initial webpage/software for the program managing various scripts (In progress) - Current Functionality

2.) Ability to Upload Geotiff files and have it display on a map (leaflet)

3.) UI elements for searching and viewing available scripts

4.) Ability to Upload Netcdf files

5.) Added the ability to clear map layer (both online and offline)

6.) Added the ability to clear the file and allow for another upload of different files (w/o refreshing the webpage)

7.) Currently fixing errors for script execution (file works but errors whenever access to the geotiff is initiated more than once)

Note: this could be due to windows access the running file and examining it
Fixed errors and other issues (Demo coming next week)



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
